    <h2>Formatting</h2>
    Sometimes, you may want the code to be formatted according to a different language than the file association
    (*.js, *.c, *.html, etc) suggests. For example, you might have HTML code in string in a javascript file and
    you want to auto-format that code.<br>
    <code class="">
        settings.json:<br>
        "files.associations": {<br>
        "*.js": "html"<br>
        }<br>
    </code>
Associating several languages with the same file extension does not cause an error, but does not seem to have 
the desired effect<br>


    <code class="">
        "*.js": ["html", "js"]<br>
    </code>
